                                              Happy Birthday~~~
                                              You picked the right one — the star never lies ✨





                                              Maybe learnt to lie??? hahahhahhahha


                                              Remember someone made a wish last year? Think harder~~~


The initial Plan was actually to give you 100 packs of OREOS for this year's birthday, not all in one day of course for the sake of your health, remember that i have been giving you Oreos on and off???
That was actually part of the plan that I will accummulate all the oreos and give maybe 13 on your 2025 birthday to make it a 100 packs
Sadly loopy can't take too much sugar and have to control :(

Given me a hard time to decide the whole new plan...


                                              Sooooooooooooo as your next (actually 8th) gift for what I have prepared, you may present this tag or texts wrote by Yours truly~~~
                                              To redeem your 100 packs of OREOS in future~~~
