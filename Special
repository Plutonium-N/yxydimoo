In case you havenâ€™t heard from me in a while, I just want to say how glad I am that youâ€™re my buddy â€” sometimes my teacher too.
Thank you for being there after my fall and for taking on blame that wasnâ€™t yours to carry.
Those times when I was being useless during our staycation, letting you make all the decisions, and then annoying you daily with my drama... I really appreciate your patience.

Iâ€™ve always wanted to thank you for all the help, support, and patience youâ€™ve shown. Youâ€™ve truly made all the difference in my life.

I know this is a bit scuffed, but Iâ€™ve always wanted to do this and finally found the patience to present it to you. Please cherish it! HAHAHA, itâ€™s a little cringe but LOVE YOU LOOPY~~~ðŸ–¤
