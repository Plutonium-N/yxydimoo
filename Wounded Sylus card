This Sylus reminds me of how Haku and Howl looked in their dragon forms — wounded, needing to recover, yet still holding onto that undeniable power.
There’s something about seeing them hurt that only makes them more unforgettable, just like Sylus — he’s got that raw, unspoken strength, even in his weakest moments.
Sometimes, even dragons need time to heal... but when they do, they’re unstoppable~~~
