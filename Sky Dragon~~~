And now, here’s your very own dragon 🩵 I’m not sure if this is your first dragon, 
but I’m not going to fight this lil' guy, even though I joke about fighting dragons with Taytay by my side. 🐉
Dragons are always strong, fierce, cute, and a little bit magical. 

I named him Lil' Blue, and he’s here to remind you that even dragons need time to heal — but once they do, their strength knows no bounds.

I know things haven’t been the easiest lately, but whenever you see Lil' Blue, remember that recovery is part of the journey, and you’ll be unstoppable when you rise.
