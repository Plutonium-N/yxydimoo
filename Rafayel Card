Sometimes heâ€™s my 2nd, sometimes my 1st â€” Rafayel is a cheeky boy who knows how to stir things up. ðŸ˜‰
Iâ€™d totally love to have him as my best friend or even a brother, 
heâ€™s the kind of person Iâ€™d want around, just like the sea â€” always there, always moving, and always unpredictable. ðŸŒŠ
Stay refreshed, stay away from reality, and let the tide take you wherever it goes... with a little help along the way~
